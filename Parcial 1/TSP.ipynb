    "**Tours:** A tour that starts in city `1`, moves to `2`, then `3`, then back to `1` will be represented by  `(1, 2, 3)`. Any valid tour of a set of cities will be a *permutation* of the cities. That means we can implement `alltours` with the built-in `permutations` function (from the `itertools` module). \n",
    "The length of a tour is the sum of the distances between adjacent cities in the tour&mdash;the sum of the lengths of the **links** between cities in the tour. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cities:** the only thing we need to know about a city is its distance to other cities. We don't need to know the city's name, population, best restaurants, or anything else.  We'll assume the distance between two cities is the [Euclidean distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance), the straight-line distance between points in a two-dimensional plane. So I want `City(300, 100)` to be the city with x-coordinate 300 and y coordinate 100. At first glance it seems like Python does not have a builtin type for a point in the two-dimensional plane, but actually there is one: complex numbers. I'll implement `City` with `complex`, which means the distance between two cities, `distance(A, B)`, is the absolute value of the vector difference between them. \n",
    "I'll also define `Cities(n)` to make a set of `n` random cities. I want `Cities(n)` to be reproducible (to return the same result when called with the same arguments), so I provide an optional argument that sets `random.seed`. "

    "* **Approximation Strategy**: If it is too hard to find a precise, optimal solution, consider finding an approximate, suboptimal solution.\n",
    "* **Greeedy Strategy**: To complete a multiple step problem, first do the step that has the best gain. Repeat. \n",
    "* **Iterative Improvement Strategy**: Use an existing algorithm to create a solution, then have another algorithm improve the solution.\n",
    "* **Ensemble Strategy**: Apply a set of algorithms to the problem, and pick the best solution. \n",
    "* **Divide and Conquer Strategy**: Split the problem in half, solve each half, and combine the two partial solutions.\n",
    "* **Stand on the Shoulders of Giants Strategy**: Find out what other people have done, and copy (or modify).\n",

We saw how Held-Karp cuts off some permutations of cities when another permutation is better.  A refinement on that is to keep track of, say, the best total length of the segment going through all the Bs cities.  Then, any time you have a partial segment through some of the Bs cities that exceeds the best total, we can stop right there, before even finishing all the Bs.  With this technique, you can find optimal tours for around 50 cities.\n",
    "* **Linear programming**: Look up the topic \"linear programming\" and see how it applies to TSP.\n",
    "* **Heuristic Algorithms**: There are many approaches for using heurisitic estimates to find good (but not optimal) tours.  For example, *ant colony optimization algorithms* make random choices of which link to follow, and then the links that occur in the best tours get reinforced with some virtual pheromones, and other ants tend to follow those pheromones. *Simulated annealing* takes its inspiration from metallurgy.\n",
    "* The **[Lin-Kernighan heuristic](http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/LKH-1.3/DOC/LKH_REPORT.pdf)** is a generalization of `improve_tour` that sometimes splits the tour into three pieces, not two, and considers all ways to put it back together. With this and other tricks, approximate algorithms  can handle hundreds of thousands of cities and come within 0.01% of the shortest possible tour.\n",
    "* The **[Christofides algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm)** gives a guarantee of 3/2 the optimal tour length (improving on the minimum-spanning-tree guarantee of 2).\n",
    "* **improved** as a function: we defined a lot of one-line functions that just call another algorithm, and then call `improve_tour` on the result.  Can you write a function, `improved(algorithm)`, which takes a TSP algorithm as argument, and returns an improved TSP algorithm that does the original algorithm and then calls `improve_tour` on the result? Make sure it handles extra arguments, and has a readable function name.\n",
    "* Why does `mst_tsp` produce a guaranteed result, while `greedy_tsp` does not, even though the two algorithms have similar structure in the way they iterate over `shortest_links_first`?\n",

His coding style is different because he uses C (in an imperative style) while I used Python (in a functional style).
